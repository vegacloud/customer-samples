## Giving Vega access to your Azure resources:
- readonly-permissions.json: attach the built in azure roles listed in the file to the created Azure App Registration. For more information on creating an Azure App Registration, our docs at [Vega Azure Integration Guide](https://docs.vegacloud.io/docs/providers/azure). 
- voperate-permissons.json: attach the built in azure roles listed in the file under 'BuiltInAzureRoles' section to the created Azure App Registration. In addition to those two roles, create a custom 'VegaOperateRole' role and add the permissions listed in the 'CustomPermissions' section of the file. For more information on creating a custom Azure role, see our docs at [Vega Azure Integration Guide](https://docs.vegacloud.io/docs/providers/azure).
